# hasItDropped
A quick script that is gonna try and text me when Frank Ocean's album drops by trawling reddit. (specifically r/hiphopheads)

It looks through all the new posts every 10 minutes and will send atext to everyone in the phoneBook(which I need to make a file) with the link when it finds the album.
